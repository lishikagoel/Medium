                    Ukraine War, 10-11 July 2022
                </h1>
                <p class="para">
                    Good morning everybody! <br><br>

                    The exchange of blows is going on — with the note that the overly centralised Russian chain of command, using archaic communication systems, is now decidedly at the disadvantage. So much so, after the loss of some 30+ ammunition and POL-dumps, plus at least five command centres to Ukrainian M142 HIMARS, Caesars and other NATO-supplied means in the last 2–3 weeks, there are ever more complaints in the Russian social media. All the possible weaknesses are exposed, not only within the command structure, but in regards of weapons and logistics, too. <br><br>

                    …looks like somebody there never expected to fight this kind of war, but convinced themselves they are so ‘super’ because they’ve caught Ukrainians off guard in 2014, then left Assadists and the IRGC do all the dying in Syria of 2015–2019, and continues suffering from collective megalomania… <br><br>

                    In other news: RUMINT from Belarus has it that the VKS is actively training in the local airspace. Moreover, several groups of Russian troops have re-entered the country and were deployed along the border to Ukraine. Obviously, the Keystone Cops are urgently in need of forcing Ukrainians to keep their troops deployed vis-à-vis Belarus, and preventing them from sending reinforcements to the frontlines in the East. <br><br>

                    Ah yes, and since yesterday, there are reports according to which it’s now the IRGC (the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran) that’s about to sell some of its UAVs to Russia, and train Russian personnel to operate them. Quite ironic to hear that, actually: back in 2015–2016 the IRGC was extremely horny about entering strategic cooperation with Russia, but Putin said nyet. Indeed, his top commanders in Syria were more often at odds with the IRGC, than cooperating with it — to the degree where the latter entered strategic cooperation with the People’s Republic of China, instead (for a full explanation of results, you might want to read a four-part feature starting here). <br><br>

                    ….which reminds me: whoever might want to monitor any possible Russo-Iranian cooperation that might result from this, should keep in mind that behind the mass of flying stuff titled ‘made in the IRI’ of our days, the actual manufacturer is somewhere in the PRC…

                <h3>
                    AIR/MISSILE WAR
                </h3>
                <p class="para">
                    A precise hit on the ammo dump in Shakhtarsk, from 10 July, was confirmed by one of locals who managed to escape to the Ukrainian side of frontlines: the site was hit and blown up at 04.00hrs in the morning. <br><br>
                    ‘In retaliation’, the VKS released eight missiles at the Odessa area, early on 11 July: apparently, it was a mix of Kh-31s and Kh-59s. One hit a residential building, another an infrastructure facility of unknown nature. <br><br>
                    In the afternoon, a volley of M142s first knocked out a Russian S-300 SAM-site in the Kherson area, then completely demolished the HQ of the XXII AC in Tavrysk. RUMINT has it that several high officers (including the CO BTG 106th VDV Division and the BTG CO 16th Spetsnaz Brigade), and up to 150 troops have been demilitarised… In the evening another volley blew up another ammunition depot (plus the dam) in Nova Khakovka, and one more hit a depot in Kherson, causing a massive conflagration.
