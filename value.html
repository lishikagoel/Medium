                    On the value of single-minded focus
                </h1>
                <p class="para">

                    What’s something you are currently working towards? Maybe you want to get into a top university, apply for a job at the best company in your field, or become the best expert in your area of expertise. <br><br>

                    We achieve good things when we do great work. And to do great work, we need to focus. As Seneca once said: “To be everywhere is to be nowhere.” <br><br>

                    If you want to achieve anything, you need to focus on that one thing. When your focus and energy are all over the place, you never make any meaningful progress. This idea sounds so simple, and yet it’s one of the hardest things to do in life. I can’t tell you how often I work on improving my focus. It’s an endless challenge because our focus fluctuates all the time. <br><br>

                    When you take care of your mental health, work on primary activities, and have a big goal, you can make A LOT of progress in stepping up your level of focus. <br><br>

                    Sometimes, it’s best to have single-minded focus for a set amount of time. For example, during the last month, I spent about 90% of my time, energy, and mental bandwidth to completing my new book. Within that single month, I finished the first draft. I wrote more in one month than in the six prior months.
