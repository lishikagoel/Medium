                I write a lot of articles about celebrities, and I always like to illustrate them with a picture of the person I’m talking about. <br><br>
                I could just grab the first picture I find on Google and claim that I’m using it under the fair-use doctrine, but I’m not so convinced that would hold up in court, and as a lawyer, I’m a bit of a stickler for following the law to the letter. <br><br>
                So, instead, I typically follow a two-step process: <br>
                Step 1: I search for a picture of the celebrity which is available for free under a Creative Commons license.
                Step 2: If I can’t find a free picture, I buy the rights from a stock photography website. (This is surprisingly cheap by the way — I’m not sure if most writers realize this, but you can often buy non-exclusive rights to an image for just a buck or two.) <br><br>
                These days, I rarely ever get to step 2 because there are just so many free pictures available. (Which also probably explains why the paid photos have gotten so cheap.) <br><br>
                But here comes the really strange part of all this. The vast majority of the time that I find a Creative Commons picture of a celebrity, it’s attributed to the same photographer: Gage Skidmore. <br><br>
                When I first started noticing this, I didn’t think it could really be just one person. How could one photographer be responsible for nearly every celebrity and politician’s photograph on Wikipedia? I assumed that “Gage Skidmore” was a company or possibly even a running joke among photographers who didn’t want to take credit for their photos. <br><br>
                I was wrong, though. It turns out Gage Skidmore is a real person, and he became one of the most widely-distributed political photographers of all time before he even moved out of his parents’ house.
