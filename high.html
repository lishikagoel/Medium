                High Performers Don’t Quit Jobs — They Quietly <br> Quit These Things

                Life is too short to get paid less than you’re worth. Let’s fix that.

                When high-performing talent quits en masse it's a red flag. <br><br>
                I once worked for a tech company where this was the case. The day before I joined two of the top two salespeople quit. <br><br>
                Seemed weird. I asked why they left… <br><br>
                “Ohhh no reason. It was time for them to move on anyway.” <br><br>
                In the weeks that followed more top performers began to quit. It was a good thing for me because I didn’t have the industry knowledge and needed to learn on the job. <br><br>
                No chance they would fire me while great talent rushed for the exits. <br><br>
                It became clear, quickly, what was going on. A few old school leaders had a boys club going on in the senior ranks. Anyone who tried to make change got the ass. I became a high-performer at that company … and then quit too. <br><br>
                High performers quit for these reasons
