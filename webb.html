                Webb reminds us: Cooperative science can solve big problems

                Every successful venture in space is a hard won highly impressive technical achievement, but the James Webb Space Telescope and its successful observation of the deep universe is an accomplishment unlike any other. <br><br>
                The telescope is the largest ever sent into space. Its giant primary mirror is 21.7 feet in diameter, with an area of 270 square feet. The mirror is made of 18 hexagonal segments made of beryllium covered in a thin layer of gold, and polished to achieve maximum precision and reflectivity. It operates and -390ºF and is protected by a sunshield the size of a tennis court. <br><br>

                The precision design and fine-tuning of the 18 hexagonal segments, the apparatus, the secondary mirror, and the four observational instruments, add up to an incredible technical achievement. What makes the Webb Telescope a frontrunner for the most daunting technical challenge ever undertaken is that all of that had to blast off, power through Earth’s atmosphere, then delicately — and perfectly — unfold in space, while traveling out to Lagrange Point 2 (L2), 1 million miles from home. <br><br>
                A team of 20,000 people around the world worked for 20 years to make this device, and its transformational mission, possible. What they have built now opens a new age of scientific exploration and will likely produce an unprecedented wave of discoveries about the early and ongoing physics of everything. <br><br>
                During the lead-in to the release of the first science images, we heard from NASA astronomer Michelle Thaller: <br><br>
                “For everyone on Earth, this is your telescope.”
